 ### 🛒 [Shopping List App](https://github.com/imran956/Shopping-List)
 I created a Shopping List app using Kotlin for the core development and Jetpack Compose for the UI design. The app features a clean and intuitive interface, 
making it easy for users to add, edit, and delete items on their shopping list.

#### Features:
- Add Items: Users can add new items to the shopping list using a button Add item.
- Edit Items: Each item has an edit icon allowing users to modify the item details.
- Delete Items: Users can remove items from the list using the delete icon.
- Data Storage: The app uses Room Database to store the shopping list items, ensuring data persistence across sessions.

This app showcases my skills in Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and Room Database, highlighting my ability to create functional and user-friendly Android applications.
